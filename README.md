1. Graphing Y(x)/X(y) functions, Parametric functions, Polar functions, and Implicit relations, as well as graphing cartesian Inequalities.

2. Deriving functions symbolically.

3. Analyzing a function(Get value at a point, Calculate limit, Area under curve, Extrema and Inflection points, Draw Tangent/Normal to curve...).

4. Adding, deleting and editing a graph.

5. Customizing the Axis and Grid colors and appearance.

6. Solving single variable equations.
